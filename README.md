We created a lwc component that can be embedded in the record page and in the connectedCallback called a js method that calls the apex class method using the imperative method of apex calling.
The apex class calls the rest resource class that returns the shipment status and returns the same status to the lwc component .
The returns status from the apex is displayed by the lwc component.
